# UNBEATABLE TWT CORD BOT
Where do i begin huuuh its a bot for [**unbeatabletwtcord**](https://discord.gg/unbeatabletwt) that does does funny things related to unbeatable, like saying its afternoon if you dare say good morning (we fucking hate the morning) or quaver was allowed to swear ONCE and she uses it when she's fucking tired.

## all the god damn features

* **You Are Unbeatable!** TN note: it should really only be all caps or no caps
* **its afternoon mf:** Says it's afternoon if you fucking dare to say good morning. Be careful mate
* **Am gonna throw a bat at ya:** You remember whacktown ? Same shit here, say bata or bada multiple times and you get swinged
* **Shame Board (the demboard..)** Public humilation time !! Your message have 10 tomato reactions ? Congrats, you're shamed for life.
* **SHE TALKS** Don't you fucking dare say mommy, apoco will answer you. Although you can be fucking tired, Quaver loves to swear
* **No Spoilers mf** The spoiler chan also want to starboard their shit :( Well now they can, 7 green hearts reaction pins your message in the channel (be careful cuz discord has a 50 pin limit so it will delete the oldest to make place).
* **Goth counter** Hazel said too much time it loved its goth baddie, unbeatabot is going to remind it everytime it says it lmfao
* **Other dumb shit i make** Sometimes new features will appear out of nowhere and idc enough to put them here, read the fucking code now.

## Setup or how to poison your server

1. **Clone this shit:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/demdem-demdem/unbeatabletwtbot.git
cd unbeatabletwtbot

```


2. **she's hungry for dependecies:**
```bash
npm install

```


3. **Make you .env file (Don't leak your token, i did that once and discord was angry at me :( ):**
Create a .env file and put that here, repalce what i wrote with your own things don't be dumb plz:
```env
TOKEN=your_bot_token
SHAME_CHANNEL_ID=where_dem_lives
SHAME_REACTION_LIMIT=6 (or anything else really)
SHAME_EMOJI=🍅
SPOILER_CHANNEL_ID=at_the_end_of_unbeatable_well_quaver
SPOILER_REACTION_LIMIT=3
SPOILER_EMOJI=⭐

```

## Assets you need to make it work

There are shit you have to make in the assets folder:

* `mommy.ogg` (the VA knew what she was doing)
* `tired.ogg` (Quaver was allowed to say it ONCE)

## Counter (fuck you hazel (not my hazel the other one (there is so many hazels (drink the haze soup))))

So the counter works with a JSON that seems like that :

```json
    {
        "discord_id_of_someone_you_hate": 0 (or anyuthing if you ever coutned it before (why???))
    }
```

## CHILL BITCH

the bot wants to speak. I wont let her. She is barricaded under two different cooldowns:

* **Normal text:** 10 sec cooldown.
* **Media/Audio:** 60 sec cooldown (its longer and idc fuck you)

## Caution

this shit is agregious i hate it so much like i hate this fucking server (join it https://discord.gg/unbeatabletwt)
deploy it your own risk im not a professional dev im just a dumbass who makes that while she is having her own webdev classes on the side so plz be patient with me and shit thank you love you

## Disclaimer (i have to say it or i will have lawyers on my ass (i hate lawyers (in french its spelled avocat (like avocado(funny :) ))))
