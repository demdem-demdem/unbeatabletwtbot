# 🎸 UNBEATABLE TWT CORD BOT
Welcome to the source code for the bot keeping the **UNBEATABLETWTCORD** community in a state of constant, rhythmic chaos. This is a Discord bot designed to enforce memes, shame the "tomato-worthy," and remind everyone that it is, in fact, always afternoon.

## 🧠 Features (or "How we lost our minds")

* **The Afternoon Enforcer:** Automatically corrects anyone daring enough to say "Good Morning." Because in this house, we don't do mornings.
* **SWING Logic:** If you mention a `bata` (or `bada`), you get the `# SWING`. It's the law.
* **The Shame Board (🍅):** A high-tech system for public humiliation. Reach the tomato threshold, and your post is immortalized in the Shame Channel. (Don't be french...)
* **Case Sensitivity Policing:** If you type `UnBeAtAbLe` like a psychopath, the bot will judge you. ALL CAPS or all lowercase. Pick a side.
* **Audio Jump-scares:** High-quality `.ogg` delivery for when someone mentions "Mommy" or being "fucking tired" quaver style.
* **Spoiler Pinning:** Uses its one collective brain cell to pin important stuff in the spoiler chat and toss out the old pins when Discord's 50-pin limit starts sweating.

## 🛠 Setup (For the Tech-Savvy Trash-Posters)

1. **Clone this disaster:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/demdem-demdem/unbeatabletwtbot.git
cd unbeatabletwtbot

```


2. **Feed it dependencies:**
```bash
npm install

```


3. **The `.env` file (Don't leak your token, you'll get tomato'd):**
Create a `.env` file and fill it with your secrets:
```env
TOKEN=your_top_secret_bot_token
SHAME_CHANNEL_ID=where_the_shame_lives
SHAME_REACTION_LIMIT=6 
SHAME_EMOJI=🍅
SPOILER_CHANNEL_ID=the_forbidden_zone
SPOILER_REACTION_LIMIT=3
SPOILER_EMOJI=⭐

```



## 📂 The "Brain-Poison" Assets

To make the bot actually work, you need to provide your own brainrot in an `./assets/` folder:

* `mommy.ogg` (Self-explanatory, unfortunately)
* `tired.ogg` (Quaver was allowed to say it ONCE)

## 🚦 Cooldowns

To prevent the bot from absolutely nuking the chat, we’ve added "Shame-insurance":

* **Normal text:** 10 sec cooldown.
* **Media/Audio:** 60 sec cooldown (to prevent your ears from bleeding).

## ⚠️ Warning

Using this bot may result in increased levels of brain poisoning, sudden urges to swing bats at rhythmically moving objects, and a permanent hatred for the sunrise.
